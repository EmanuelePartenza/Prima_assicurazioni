a me, Alessandro

Hi Emanuele, thanks for getting in touch with us!

Your profile seems quite interesting!

A couple of preliminary questions:

* In which of the following fields you have some experience in?

  * Python
  * Kubernetes
  * TypeScript

  I understand these are wildly different topics, but we're a small
  team and we rebalance tasks depending on the skills of new hires. So
  don't feel bad if you have only one of these, that's fine.

* Where are you based?
  Our positions are usually hybrid (in person/remote), in particular at
  the beginning, but we can discuss full remote.

* Can you share with us your salary expectations?
  For this position the gross retribution range (RAL) for is 35-55
  kEUR/y.
  We also have the option to collaborate with you as a contractor. In
  that case, we can discuss terms.

* Could you please take a look at the following exercise and send us a
  solution?

  If you also have experience in Kubernetes, it'd be nice if you could
  take this short (30') exercise too:

  In exchange for your effort, if you complete it in a satisfactory
  way, we'll send you a copy of a book we consider foundational for our
  company, no matter the final outcome of the interview.

Enjoy your day!
