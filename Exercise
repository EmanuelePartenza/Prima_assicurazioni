The goal of this exercise is to provide a basis for further discussion and investigate the candidate’s approach to common problems.
There aren’t entirely wrong or correct answers.

We estimate the base exercise will take approximately 4 hours.
If it takes you more, feel free to stop.

You cannot use AI assistants such as ChatGPT or Copilot.

Thanks!

Exercise
Given a repo, visualize the graph of git commits fetched through the GitHub API:

Fetch the default branch
Fetch the whole history (or a part of it)
Build the commit graph (each commit has zero or more parents)
Verify that the commit graph is acyclic
Print the graph in a text file with the Graphviz’s Dot Language
Rules
You have to use Python>=3.7
All functions/classes/etc. must be properly type annotated
You should use the GitHub’s GraphQL API. The suggested Python library for GraphQL is gql (but you can use another one if you prefer). As a fallback you can use GitHub REST API instead.
The use of external libraries for verifying that the graph is acyclic are not allowed.
Extra points
Write a small test suite
Support authentication for GitHub APIs
Generate an image for the .dot file generated from the graph
